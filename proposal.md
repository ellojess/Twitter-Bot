# Project Proposal 

There are some people in the world (such as myself) who are not as adept as others in the art of social media platforms such as Twitter. I propose creating a Twitter bot that handles populating an individuals Twitter with retweets from hashtags the user themselves have declared they're interested in. In doing so, this will automate the process of retweeting and keep an individuals Twitter active.
